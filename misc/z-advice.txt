Advice of the Preet

i also thaught the same way
but it does not make a proper grid
think how a grid looks, they said make it 16 x 16
16 rows and 16 columns
so the best way i came up with is to make a column of divs first
with flex
and then in those divs make them flex box as well and same number of divs in each div of the column
it gives me a grid of equal number horizontally and vertically

but with flex wrap you have to put number of divs and it will not be a perfect grid

before my current solution i also thaught same

but then i realises in grid there are same number or rows and columns

16 horizontal and 16 vertical total of 256

here 16 is common

you can ask user for this number

What do you mean? What kind of settings do you have on the css? Are you using flexbox or something else? Are the divs generated by the loop inside another div, they have a child-prent's mechanism inside the loop?

Did you set a max height and width to the container, setting a wrap makes the child go to the next row and creating more space, you need to work with shrink and grow to manage the childs to either fill the space onside the container evenly or shrink to not have to expand it @albert 

Im guessing you are working on etch a sketch, I suggest u go over the flexbox info again cause I had to restructure my loop for creating boxes accordingly to the needs of flexbox

You can use it (flex-wrap), but pair it with shrink and grow or stretch to not having the boxes go out of the container
And setting a flex-basis for the boxes is a good idea

My approach was using other boxes to contain the squares, that way I had a chance to apply the flex properties how i wanted to. You need to review the loop to generate everything tho

For example if i had to do 100 squares, id have 10 small containers

-----

Preet's approach is changing the number of rows and divs --> 6*6

My approach is chanhing only the number of box --> 36


in my version the square size is set by me and the user is just changing the number of divs per row and columnn

where as flex-wrap the outer container will be set by you and the inner square would be chnage by user
